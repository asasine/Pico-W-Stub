# Generated Stubs

These stubs have been generated using [Micropython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber). They _aren't_ used in the distributed stubs (in `/dist`) since the `.pyi` files there have been hand-curated.

The purpose of keeping the auto-generated stubs is to more easily track what's changed between firmware versions. The changes visible in Git client tools identify new methods, classes and modules that require manual intervention in the curated `/frozen` stubs.
